# Visualizing Data with Leaflet

   The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes.

 For this project, I created a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from your data set based on their longitude and latitude.

   * The data markers reflects the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger and darker in color.

   * Popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.

   * Created a legend that will provide context for the map data.
